## üß† Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are key practices in modern DevOps. Mastery of CI/CD tools and concepts is essential for DevOps engineers, especially in cloud-native environments.

This guide covers:

- Core CI/CD concepts
- Differences between popular tools
- Sample questions and answers
- Real-world scenarios
- Hands-on practice tasks

## üß± CI/CD Fundamentals

- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automatically integrating code and running tests on push or PR.
- **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery):** Automatically deploying tested code to staging or production.
- **Pipeline Stages:** Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy
- **Triggers:** Git events (push, pull_request), schedules, or manual approvals
- **Runners/Agents:** Execute jobs (GitHub-hosted, self-hosted, etc.)
- **Secrets Management:** Secure storage for tokens and keys
- **Artifacts vs Cache:**
  - **Artifacts**: Store build results (binaries, reports)
  - **Cache**: Store reusable files (like dependencies) to speed up builds

## ‚ùì Common Interview Questions

### 1. **What is CI/CD and why is it important?**
> CI/CD improves code quality and deployment speed by automating the build, test, and deployment process.

### 2. **How do GitHub Actions and GitLab CI differ?**
> GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with GitHub and uses workflows defined in `.github/workflows`. GitLab CI uses `.gitlab-ci.yml` and supports native Docker builds.

### 3. **How are secrets managed?**
> In GitHub/GitLab, secrets are stored in repo settings and injected as environment variables. In Jenkins, use the Credentials Plugin.

### 4. **What‚Äôs the difference between cache and artifact?**
> Cache speeds up builds by reusing dependencies. Artifacts store outputs like reports or binaries for use in later steps or stages.

### 5. **Describe a CI/CD failure you've resolved.**
> Talk about real-world experience: what failed, how you diagnosed it, and how you resolved or improved the pipeline afterward.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical YAML Examples

### GitHub Actions (Basic Node.js Build)
```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
