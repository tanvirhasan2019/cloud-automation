## Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. Python & Programming Fundamentals

**Q: Explain the use of dataclasses in this script.**

**A:** Dataclasses provide a clean way to define configuration objects with automatic `__init__`, `__repr__`, and other methods. In our `AlertConfig` class, it eliminates boilerplate code and provides type hints, making the configuration structure clear and maintainable. It's more readable than dictionaries and provides better IDE support.

**Q: How does exception handling work in this script?**

**A:** The script uses multiple layers of exception handling:
- **Client initialization**: Catches AWS credential/permission errors
- **Resource queries**: Handles API rate limits and service unavailability
- **Alert sending**: Manages network failures for email/Slack
- **File operations**: Handles disk space and permission issues

Each exception is logged with context, allowing for debugging while preventing script crashes.

**Q: Explain the logging configuration.**

**A:** The script uses Python's logging module with:
- **Multiple handlers**: File (`aws_monitor.log`) and console output
- **Formatted messages**: Timestamp, log level, and message
- **Different log levels**: INFO for normal operations, WARNING for alerts, ERROR for failures
- **Centralized logger**: Single logger instance used throughout

### 2. AWS Services & Architecture

**Q: Which AWS services does this script interact with and why?**

**A:** 
- **EC2**: Monitors compute instances for CPU and disk usage
- **CloudWatch**: Retrieves metrics and statistics for all services
- **RDS**: Monitors database performance and connections
- **S3**: Tracks storage usage and bucket sizes
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python providing programmatic access

**Q: How does CloudWatch metric collection work?**

**A:** CloudWatch metrics are collected using:
- **Namespace**: Service identifier (AWS/EC2, AWS/RDS, etc.)
- **Metric name**: Specific metric (CPUUtilization, DatabaseConnections)
- **Dimensions**: Resource identifiers (InstanceId, DBInstanceIdentifier)
- **Time range**: Recent data (last 10 minutes for most metrics)
- **Statistics**: Average, Maximum, Sum based on metric type

**Q: What are the limitations of this monitoring approach?**

**A:**
- **CloudWatch costs**: Each API call has a cost
- **Metric delay**: CloudWatch data has 1-5 minute delays

## Sample Interview Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Production Issue
**Interviewer**: "Your monitoring script is running but not detecting a known high CPU issue. Walk me through your troubleshooting process."

**Response**: I would follow a systematic approach:
1. First, check the monitoring logs to see if the script is running and querying CloudWatch successfully
2. Verify the CPU threshold configuration - it might be set too high
3. Check if CloudWatch has recent data for that instance using the AWS console
4. Confirm the instance is in the correct region and has proper tags
5. Test the CloudWatch API call manually with the same parameters
6. Check if detailed monitoring is enabled for 1-minute granularity

### Scenario 2: Design Decision
**Interviewer**: "Why did you choose to use email and Slack for alerts instead of SNS?"

**Response**: While SNS would be more scalable for a large organization, this implementation focuses on immediate, actionable alerts for smaller teams. Email provides a persistent record and works universally, while Slack enables quick team communication and response. However, for production at scale, I would recommend SNS with multiple subscribers, including integration with PagerDuty or similar tools for escalation policies.

### Scenario 3: Architecture Discussion
**Interviewer**: "How would you modify this to work across multiple AWS accounts?"

**Response**: I would implement cross-account access using:
1. Create IAM roles in each target account with appropriate monitoring permissions
2. Modify the script to assume roles using STS
3. Add account configuration with role ARNs and external IDs
4. Implement account-specific alert routing
5. Consider using AWS Organizations for centralized management
6. Add account identifiers to alert messages for clarity

This demonstrates understanding of enterprise AWS architecture and security best practices.
